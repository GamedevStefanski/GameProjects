"To do list" application was a part of a tutorial.
The idea of it's job is similiar to Jira or Trello, but for a single user only and a very simple layout without many functionalites.

It helped me to understand the basics of using the JSON files, therefore saving the data of the app even after closing it.
It's also ready to port it to mobiles.
