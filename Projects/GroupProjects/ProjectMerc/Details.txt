Project Merc is a group project that I'm working on with 3 other developers.
It's a cooperative dungeon-based fantasy RPG.

To coordinate our work we're using Plastic SCM and Jira. To create the online functionalites we decided to use Photon Engine.
Everybody in the team has a different role. For now mine was to take care of the UI and online features.
Unfortunately, the game is not ready to showcase the gameplay yet, so I've only included some screenshots and a short video of the things we managed to achieve.
