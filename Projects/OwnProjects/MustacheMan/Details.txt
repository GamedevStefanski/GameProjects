The Mustache Man project is one of my strangest creations. While working on it I was heavily inspired by "Reventure".
It's a platformer heavily based on solving puzzles and a lot of humour directed to the player via messages left on the map.

It may not be the prettiest or the best game I've made, but it's the closest one to have its release.
The player's task is to find a golden log for his fireplace and this task requires a lot of running and looking for useful items.
